It all started from the beginning. I've encountered a challenge at work and decided to write an article about it. (/_ Link to Linting... _/). Time moved on and I've written a couple more (even though neither of them got the traction of the first, beginners luck I guess). After publishing a few articles, I've started getting more into the world of publishing technological articles. A lot of buzzwords were thrown in the air - cross-posting, SEO, canonical links and more. I've noticed that most of the serious people who post articles have a blog of their own from which they share (or cross-post, as the lingo goes) to other platforms, and I was thinking to myself - Why shouldn't I have one? You could say it's not really worth the hassle (I don't have a clear vision as to how many articles I plan to write, and I certainly don't have the time to write every week or so), but I thought it would be a fun project, and I hoped to learn something from it.  
I have a decent experience with web development, mostly in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and I was thinking I could make a use of it in my blog. Around that time I stumbled upon [this post](https://mike.biful.co/gatsby-dev-to-cross-poster-brainstorm), where the author suggested using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for such things. I've never really worked with Gatsby before, but after a quick look through the documentation (which is superb!) I figured it would be a perfect solution for my blog.
