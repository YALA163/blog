After publishing a few articles, I've started getting more into the world of publishing technological articles. A lot of buzzwords were thrown in the air - cross-posting, SEO etc. I've noticed that most of the serious people who post articles have a blog of their own from which they cross-post to other platforms, and I was thinking to myself - Why should I have one?  
I have a decent experience with web development, mostly in `React` and I was thinking I could make a use of it in my blog.
